# NYC-restaurant-inspection-records
A simple API for accessing New York City restaurant' inspection records.

Node.js is required to run this on a local server. Type `node server.js` to start.

Data is provided by the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). Source: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/43nn-pn8j.json

## Update
Looks like the database might be accessible via the [Socrata Open Data API](https://dev.socrata.com). Let's see if that API offers a simpler way to query the data.
