# NYC-restaurant-inspection-records
An API for accessing New York City restaurant' inspection records.

Live demo: https://nyc-restaurant-inspector.herokuapp.com

If you want to run the API on a local server, you need to use Node.js. Type `node server.js` in command line to start.

Data is provided by the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). Source: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/43nn-pn8j.json

## Querying with SoQL
The API interacts with the [Socrata Open Data API](https://dev.socrata.com). Socrata uses a query language called SoQL, or “Socrata Query Language.” SoQL makes it easier to query data.
